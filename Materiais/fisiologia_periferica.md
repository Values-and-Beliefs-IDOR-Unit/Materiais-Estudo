# Some Material on Peripheral Physiology Analysis

## [NeuroKit](https://github.com/rpanderson/NeuroKit](https://github.com/neuropsychology/NeuroKit)
NeuroKit is an open-source Python package providing easy-to-use, state-of-the-art, and comprehensive functions to process and analyze neurophysiological data. It supports various physiological signals, including ECG, EDA, EMG, and EEG, and offers advanced features like signal pre-processing, event-related analysis, and heart rate variability computation.

*It has nice tutorials on different signal processing with example datasets as well as basic introduction to the different types of signals*

## [pyEDA](https://github.com/HealthSciTech/pyEDA)
pyEDA is a Python library that analyzes Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals. It includes functions for preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization of EDA data, making it useful for psychophysiology, neuroscience, and wearable technology research.

## [HeartPy -Python Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit](https://python-heart-rate-analysis-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
The Python Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit is a Python library for analyzing heart rate signals. It provides tools for the preprocessing, visualization, and extracting features from heart rate data, including time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. *Focused on PPG signal***

## [ECG Library Comparison](https://samproell.io/posts/signal/ecg-library-comparison/)
This article by Sam Proell compares various libraries available for ECG signal processing. It covers their functionalities, strengths, and weaknesses, providing insights into which library might best suit different ECG analysis tasks.

## [ECG Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/EthanNewell/ECG_RAoS/blob/main/ECG%20Analysis.ipynb)
This Jupyter Notebook by Ethan Newell provides an example of ECG signal analysis using Python. It includes steps for signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization, demonstrating practical applications of different techniques and tools in the analysis of ECG data. *It shows how to compute the stress index used by Kubios (which is the squared value of Baevskyâ€™s Stress Index )
